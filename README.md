# AoC 2025 - Lucas Dunker

My AoC code solutions for AoC 2025! All problems are done in Python using the standard library, and have been completed the day they came out - no exceptions. All solutions except for day 10 and day 11 were completed with ~~no~~ little outside assistance.
Day 10 stumped me with the runtime complexity of the solution, and needed extensive googling to figure out how to get a working solution; day 12 stumped me with the seeming insanity of the problem statement, but was easy to code up once I knew the trick.

This was my first year getting every star! I might start working backward through the years in different languages :)
