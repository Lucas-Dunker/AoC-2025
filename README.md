# AoC 2025 - Lucas Dunker

My AoC code solutions for AoC 2025! All problems are done in Python using the standard library, and have been ~~~~completed~~ attempted the day they came out - no exceptions. I made it to day 10 on my own before getting stumped - I don't know what integer programming is 😢
